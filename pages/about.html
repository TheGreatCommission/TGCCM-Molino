                        ⁃	The Great Commission Christian Ministry - Molino is a small church located in Progressive 20-21, Molino 1, Bacoor City, in the province of Cavite, Philippines; and was formally affiliated and became a daughter church of TGCCM - Imus in the year 1999 led by Ptr Modesto Pacson. It was an existing local church before and was called TRUST IN JESUS CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES. <br>
                        ⁃	During the TIJ days, Ptr Mody lead the church for one year and then after that appointed Ptr Jorge Limas Jr. to be its new pastor which the members welcomed. <br>
                        ⁃	In 2009, the church made the decision to change its name and became TGCCM-Molino to be identified easily with the mother church. <br>
                        ⁃	At the time when Ptr Jorge took over, the church is just using somebody else's property for Sunday Worship and other activities and he and the other members find it uncomfortable. They do not own the place. And then the church started to include in prayer to find a new place, even if it is to be rented. And the Lord answered that prayer. <br>
                        ⁃	In the year 2001, the church was able to acquire/buy a property located  also in Molino 1 and started to build its place of worship. <br>
                        ⁃	Now by the grace of God, TGCCM MOLINO is still standing faithfully focusing on the ministry of discipling, teaching and training its members for the work of Christian Ministry.

                        <li><strong>Article I</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally inspired Word of God, the final authority for faith and life, without error in the original writings, infallible, and God-breathed (2 Tim 3:16, 17; Matt 5:18; 2 Pet 1:20-21; John 16:12, 13).</p>
                        <li><strong>Article II</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe in one triune God, eternally existing in Three Persons —Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections (Deut 6:4; 2 Cor 13:14). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article III</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that the eternal Son of God became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He, the Lord Jesus Christ, might reveal God and redeem sinful men (John 1:1, 2, 14; Luke 1:35). We believe that He accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Rom 3:24-25; 1 Pet 1:3-5). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1:9, 10; Heb 7:25; 9:24; Rom 8:34; 1 John 2:1, 2).</p>
                        <li><strong>Article IV</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Trinity, though omnipresent from all eternity, took up His abode in the world in a special sense on the day of Pentecost according to the divine promise, dwells in every believer, and by His baptism, which occurs at conversion, unites all believers to Christ in one body, and that He, as the indwelling One, is the source of all power and all acceptable worship and service (John 14:16,17; 16:7-15; 1 Cor 6:19; Eph 2:22). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article V</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam's sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God; and that man is totally depraved and thus of himself utterly unable to remedy His lost condition (Gen 1:26, 27; Eph 2:1-3; Rom 3:22, 23; 5:12). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article VI</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that salvation is a gift, made available through the grace of God totally apart from meritorious works on the part of sinful men, and must be personally appropriated by faith in Jesus Christ (John 1:12; 5:24; Acts 4:12; Rom 4:4, 5; Gal 3:10-14; Eph 2:8, 9). We believe it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation as taught by God's Word. We believe the Bible clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion for the flesh (Rom 8:16; 13:13; Gal 5:13; Tit 2:11-15; 1 John 5:13).</p>
                        <li><strong>Article VII</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that the Church, which is the body and espoused bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of born-again persons (Eph 1:22, 23; 5:25-27; 1 Cor 12:12-14; 2 Cor 11:2). We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28- 32; 1 Tim 3:1-13; Tit 1:5-11). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ left two ordinances to be observed by the local church in commemoration of His person and work. The one is that of baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The other is the partaking of the Lord's Supper (Matt 28:19, 20; Acts 2:41, 46, 47; 16:33; 1 Cor 11:23-32). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article VIII</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe in the bodily resurrection of all people, the saved to eternal life and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment (Matt 25:44; John 14:1-3; 1 Thess 1:10; 4:13-17). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article IX</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe in the sure return of the Lord Jesus Christ to establish His kingdom on earth, that this second coming will be a literal, bodily, personal return; and that His coming for His bride, the Church, constitutes the "blessed hope" set before us, for which we should be constantly looking (Matt 24:27, 30, 44; John 14:1-3; 1 Thess 1:10; 4:13-17). </p>
                        <li><strong>Article X</strong></li>
                        <p class="accordion-content">We believe that it is the obligation of the saved to witness by life and by word to the truths of the Holy Scripture and to seek to proclaim the Gospel to all mankind (Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8; 2 Cor 5:19, 20). </p>
